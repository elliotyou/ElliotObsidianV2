and everyone who knew her was devastated ~~, which~~  `when she` csuddently vanished `without a trace` 8 years ago

I hope `you're hoped`

She was so loving and caring, and `put  herself last in` everything.

Ken Anderson `whom Corey met` online after her divorced `from her first husband` the father `of her` two daughers . 

`all the memories i have of him`  he's always been very controlling and manipulative and very his way

But Corey had fallen in love with Ken `at first sight`, and they were married `within Month`.

`he mesmerised her`.

Corey and Ken would have a son Zachary now 14, `and for a while` they seemed happy.

But then it started falling apart. 

The longer they saw each other, the harder `it got`... cuz I feel like `that's when she started realizing ` who `he trully` was.

And their marriage would collapse when Corrie made a shocking discovery while `looking` through `some of` Ken's papers.

He wasn't really her husband. He was a `bigamist` `who` never divorced `his` previous wife his `fourth`.

A horrified Correy managed to track down Ken's first wife Stephanie Anderson `who had married him when` she was just 16 and preganent with the first of 4 children they had together. 

To me, `with Ken there's` just evel about him.

Stephanied told Corey horror stories about her 12-marrage `to` Ken
