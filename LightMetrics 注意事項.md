We’ve created a new account for you on LightMetrics, and there should be a verification mail sent to your mailbox last week. (matthew.talia@linxio.com) You can find the portal URL in that mail. 

沒問題。剛剛已經將帳號創建好。再麻煩提醒Sabastian 他會需要去收Light Metrics的啟用信(有可能在垃圾信箱)來做啟用的動作。信件內會有LM的URL可以登入。

Regarding LightMetrics Calibrations:
A self-calibration step is necessary before lane and forward collision warnings and violations are enabled. This calibration process takes a few minutes of driving on a road with clearly marked lanes, at a speed greater than 30 mph, to complete (verbal alert - “following distance monitoring starts”). The calibration process happens immediately during the first trip after installation, and is stored and reused for subsequent trips. Pre-calibration, forward collision warning performance could be inconsistent.
