we're always so thrilled to have you here
you are one of our favortes of course (we say that to everybody)
we don't wanna hurt `anybody's` feeling but you really are one of our favortes 
these 2 cases are actually, Judy, are the kind of cases where we need your level of `expertise` 
we always try when `you're coming on` to make sure that we maximize your `expertise` 
>be coming on

so `we're putting you to` work today
a nurse in texas is convicted of killing patients by injecting air into their arteries right after heart surgery 
the `nurse's` atterny says the hospital is the one that had issues, and the hospital is making the nurse a `scapegoat`
>arteries
>scapegoat

so of course the question is, which is very jarring to the rest of us, how could a `caregiver` ever turn around and `then` be accused `as` the one trying to injure and kill people. it's very jarring 
>jarring

and the nurse is now facing the death penalty 
but first, a social media `star` `is` accused of shooting and killing a friend during a drunken night in `Houston` but her arrest was somehow `kept from the` public for `months`

I don't how you can live your life so publicly and yet have this case be buried 
this to me is the most fascenating and suspicious part of this. 
although there're many suspicious things here. 
ok, so, dr. Judy, let's set up what the crime is, and how it's described by Texas' authorities
>live sb's life
>and yet
>have sth buried
>this to me

and then you can jump in with your expertiese 
so, they said that on January 17th `of` this year, 
there was a shooting in the Houston home of a `tick-tock` star known for costplay videos 
>tick-tock

costplay, being short for costume play , and I guess Judy, people dress up as characters often from the `world` animation, comics, `sci-fi` many reenact scenes, or they create environments in which they play that character
it's a huge `interactive` community 
do you think that's a good description of costplay 
>the world animation

yeah, you know i `was` actually a huge fan of costplay, especially during `grad` school, cuz i'm a video gamer, and i love cartoon and anime and those were some of the costumes that we dressed up in when I was younger with my friends 
>cartoon and anime
>grad school

and i've actually been `to` conferences and ~~the fans~~ `events`  ~~were~~ `where` basically `there's` a huge amount of costplay 

i guess fans ~~of~~ `or` the costplay community being ~~presented~~ `present at` those for example comic cons, `it was` in San Diego many many years.
>sth being present at ....

`and that's where` `i went to` my doctor program. `and a lot of my firends and i would go to these conferences `
>that's where ....

so i know exactly what you are talking about 

oh my god the secret life of dr. judy hill. I love it !

i know it's so weird, `like people are like` wait a minute, i've been playing video games since i was 5 years old

so i grew up ~~with~~ `on` stuff like street fighter, ~~takin~~ `Tekken`,  `Mortal Kombat`, you know `and` things like that. and they ~~are~~ were always ~~being~~ `big` ~~apperence~~ `appearences` `at these` costply conferences 
>Tekken: 鐵拳系列
>Mortal Kombat: 真人快打
>be big appearences at ...
>grew up on stuff li ke ...

oh my god you really are the perfect person for this case beyond anything I've ever expected 
it's like a bonus today, a bonus episode

ok now let's talk about the crime and people involved here. 

### 03:56

this `tick-tocker` went by serveral names and several handles 
`Marianne`, Oliver Snow, is 23 years old, and goes by, and uses the ~~day~~  `they them` pronounced 
Snow went by `Yandere Freak` that's one of the names and also by the name of snowthesaltqueen 
> handles
> go by

so we're gonna just refer to this `individual` as snow 
i think it just makes it easier for all of us to follow 
snow as 1.6 million follwers on tick tock, which is a lot
 
snow is considered as a celebrity expecially in the Houston area, where snow recorded videos and has a reputation for using real weapons
and knives and swords in some of the videos
so apperently snow and 5 firends were snow's house 

they admitted there were drinking, smoking pot, watching TV, and they all started playing out some scenes, 
snow allegedly picked up gun, snow said that, it had been left behind by snow's boy firend, 
> smoke pot

and so , there're something going on, they are playing, they are doing these things, and then snow points the gun at the head of one of snow's friends, pulls the trigger, killing 19-year-old `Helen Hastings`, who was a student at `Oberlin` `college`

so...part of a mistery here is..well...first of all, this is a loaded gun, and we see this play out ~~of~~ an awful lot, where people play with loaded guns and this is the absolute worst thing ~~it~~ `that` can happen
>an awful lot

that's part of it, you know 
we see this level of violence 
then the next thing is, because the criticism that snow used real weapons sometimes in snow's videos, so was this really an accident?
`in that` sense?
> in that sense 

do you get a pass because you're drunk? and playing games?
it's a horrific tragedy 
and i think that this is the unfortunate part of the story as there're so many unfortunate part `of` this story 
but it may have been an accident the night ~~it just~~ `that this` happened but at the same time `if` this ~~is~~ `was like` a routine way 
that they thought it would be a way to get their yayas have fun 
>yayas

essentially almost kind of you know move that `dopamine receptor` where there were kind of this excitment phase getting into`fight or flight` ~~off~~ `all for` the heck of it 
>dopamine receptor
>fight or flight
>all for the heck of it

at some point an accident like this was gonna happen
i mean you're loading and unloading guns and you're mixing alcohol and drugs with that your judgement is impaired
and there's impulse control issues that come with alcohol and drug  use 
>at some point

this was gonna happen. this was an accident waiting to happen anna
`no good could come of it`
> no good could come of it

so according to the `harris` county `sheriff's` office 
at some points, they were all watching the batman TV show called `Gotham`, and snow said "hey, I've got a gun like the one that the penguin character is using" so then snow brought out a ~~glog hand gun~~ `glock handgun` and clamed that the gun was not loaded 
> a glock handgun

they are messing aroung for hours they told police with the gun so to miracle no body was not injured 
prior to that `if` this ~~the~~ `is` true version of the events 
> prior to that 

because part of the problem is , some of the witnesses are claiming including snow, that they really don't remember
because they were impaired
which is both convenient and maybe also true. i do not know , ok , so then, um...
when snow points the gun , snow tells police, it was Helen who asked that she put the gun to ~~the~~ `her` head ~~that will~~ `and` be shot like the show
so they were watching. 
> get shot in the head

i don't know if that's true, but the sad thing is that Helen was shot in `the` head is sent to the hospital immediately via ~~an~~ ambulence is put ~~online~~ `on life` support and then dies about 2 days later 
it's a horrific, horrfic tragedy. 
> is put on life support

You know how I say i don't understand how this happened in January . We only find out about it in september now everyone is talking about it in October.
Here is the part that gets me. Ok so Helen, this young women with the rest of her life ahead of her, the college, `oberlin` college sends an email and `notifies` all the students that she passed 

but the university doesn't say how `she's` died
so many of her friends , and fellow classmates believe that `she's` killed herself
so that's kind of the narrative that `are` operating under 
> be operating under

then what we don't know is that apparently snow is indicted on second degree felony manslaughter charges in April

so this happens in January, someone dies ~~with~~  `during` this playing around 
and it's nowhere on social media. `like` how is that possible
how is ~~that~~ `it` kept such a secret

it's amasing. ~~it's~~ `especially` because as you mentioned, anna, she has 1.6 million follwers 
and snow ~~is~~ `was` very active on social media, this is not ~~someone~~ `somebody` who only posted once ~~a~~ `every` week or ~~in~~ two weeks.

Snow is always on social media, and continuing to ~~post~~ `pose` in their costplay costume and essentially 
still ~~reinteracting~~ `reenacting` some of these seemingly dangerous ~~ex~~ `acts` on social media ~~across all~~ `all across` this time
>pose
>reenacting
>all across this time

yeah, there was a lot of criticism that escpecially once this news came out that snow had done some videos where ~~there~~ `what` appears to be like , fake blood stains behind her, and there was some violence. `and you're like` how in the world can you do that if you are the one who allegedly pull the trigger and led to someone's death 
and you've now been charged with this
that's something that is perplexing here.

here's what also is intresting. she is indicted, right? and in April she isn't indicted she is free on bond but there're conditions 
> free on bond
> conditions

she has curfews . snow has curfews, and snows has conditions about not only the time that snow has to be home, but also drug testing and `a` few other restrictions 
~~it~~ turns out that snow has reportedly violated those conditions by going to an ~~animate~~ `anime` convention in Houston in July 

so apparently that's probally when things start to become maybe more public , because there're more and more of court appearences and judgements to against to.
