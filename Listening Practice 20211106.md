we're always so thrilled to have you here
you are one of our favortes of course (we say that to everybody)
we don't wanna hurt `anybody's` feeling but you really are one of our favortes 
these 2 cases are actually, Judy, are the kind of cases where we need your level of `expertise` 
we always try when `you're coming on` to make sure that we maximize your `expertise` 
>be coming on

so `we're putting you to` work today
a nurse in texas is convicted of killing patients by injecting air into their arteries right after heart surgery 
the `nurse's` atterny says the hospital is the one that had issues, and the hospital is making the nurse a `scapegoat`
>arteries
>scapegoat

so of course the question is, which is very jarring to the rest of us, how could a `caregiver` ever turn around and `then` be accused `as` the one trying to injure and kill people. it's very jarring 
>jarring

and the nurse is now facing the death penalty 
but first, a social media `star` `is` accused of shooting and killing a friend during a drunken night in `Houston` but her arrest was somehow `kept from the` public for `months`

I don't how you can live your life so publicly and yet have this case be buried 
this to me is the most fascenating and suspicious part of this. 
although there're many suspicious things here. 
ok, so, dr. Judy, let's set up what the crime is, and how it's described by Texas' authorities
>live sb's life
>and yet
>have sth buried
>this to me

and then you can jump in with your expertiese 
so, they said that on January 17th `of` this year, 
there was a shooting in the Houston home of a `tick-tock` star known for costplay videos 
>tick-tock

costplay, being short for costume play , and I guess Judy, people dress up as characters often from the `world` animation, comics, `sci-fi` many reenact scenes, or they create environments in which they play that character
it's a huge `interactive` community 
do you think that's a good description of costplay 
>the world animation

yeah, you know i `was` actually a huge fan of costplay, especially during `grad` school, cuz i'm a video gamer, and i love cartoon and anime and those were some of the costumes that we dressed up in when I was younger with my friends 
>cartoon and anime
>grad school

[連結](https://youtu.be/64s7txBMUQ0?t=181)

and i've actually been `to` conferences and ~~the fans~~ `events`  ~~were~~ `where` basically `there's` a huge amount of costplay 

i guess fans ~~of~~ `or` the costplay community being ~~presented~~ `present at` those for example comic cons, `it was` in San Diego many many years.
>sth being present at ....

`and that's where` `i went to` my doctor program. `and a lot of my firends and i would go to these conferences `
>that's where ....

so i know exactly what you are talking about 

oh my god the secret life of dr. judy hill. I love it !

i know it's so weird, `like people are like` wait a minute, i've been playing video games since i was 5 years old

so i grew up ~~with~~ `on` stuff like street fighter, ~~takin~~ `Tekken`,  `Mortal Kombat`, you know `and` things like that. and they ~~are~~ were always ~~being~~ `big` ~~apperence~~ `appearences` `at these` costply conferences 
>Tekken: 鐵拳系列
>Mortal Kombat: 真人快打
>be big appearences at ...
>grew up on stuff li ke ...

oh my god you really are the perfect person for this case beyond anything I've ever expected 
it's like a bonus today, a bonus episode

ok now let's talk about the crime and people involved here. 

### 03:56

this `tick-tocker` went by serveral names and several handles 
`Marianne`, Oliver Snow, is 23 years old, and goes by, and uses the ~~day~~  `they them` pronounced 
Snow went by `Yandere Freak` that's one of the names and also by the name of snowthesaltqueen 
> handles
> go by

so we're gonna just refer to this `individual` as snow 
i think it just makes it easier for all of us to follow 
snow as 1.6 million follwers on tick tock, which is a lot
 
snow is considered as a celebrity expecially in the Houston area, where snow recorded videos and has a reputation for using real weapons
and knives and swords in some of the videos
so apperently snow and 5 firends were snow's house 

they admitted there were drinking, smoking pot, watching TV, and they all started playing out some scenes, 
snow allegedly picked up gun, snow said that, it had been left behind by snow's boy firend, 
> smoke pot

and so , there're something going on, they are playing, they are doing these things, and then snow points the gun at the head of one of snow's friends, pulls the trigger, killing 19-year-old `Helen Hastings`, who was a student at `Oberlin` `college`

so...part of a mistery here is..well...first of all, this is a loaded gun, and we see this play out ~~of~~ an awful lot, where people play with loaded guns and this is the absolute worst thing ~~it~~ `that` can happen
>an awful lot


### 05:39

[[2021-11-08 (一)]]

that's part of it, you know 
we see this level of violence 
then the next thing is, because the criticism that snow used real weapons sometimes in snow's videos, so was this really an accident?
`in that` sense?
> in that sense 

do you get a pass because you're drunk? and playing games?
it's a horrific tragedy 
and i think that this is the unfortunate part of the story as there're so many unfortunate part `of` this story 
but it may have been an accident the night ~~it just~~ `that this` happened but at the same time `if` this ~~is~~ `was like` a routine way 
that they thought it would be a way to get their yayas have fun 
>yayas

essentially almost kind of you know move that `dopamine receptor` where there were kind of this excitment phase getting into`fight or flight` ~~off~~ `all for` the heck of it 
>dopamine receptor
>fight or flight
>all for the heck of it

at some point an accident like this was gonna happen
i mean you're loading and unloading guns and you're mixing alcohol and drugs with that your judgement is impaired
and there's impulse control issues that come with alcohol and drug  use 
>at some point

this was gonna happen. this was an accident waiting to happen anna
`no good could come of it`
> no good could come of it

so according to the `harris` county `sheriff's` office 
at some points, they were all watching the batman TV show called `Gotham`, and snow said "hey, I've got a gun like the one that the penguin character is using" so then snow brought out a ~~glog hand gun~~ `glock handgun` and clamed that the gun was not loaded 
> a glock handgun

they are messing aroung for hours they told police with the gun so to miracle no body was not injured 
prior to that `if` this ~~the~~ `is` true version of the events 
> prior to that 

because part of the problem is , some of the witnesses are claiming including snow, that they really don't remember
because they were impaired
which is both convenient and maybe also true. i do not know , ok , so then, um...
when snow points the gun , snow tells police, it was Helen who asked that she put the gun to ~~the~~ `her` head ~~that will~~ `and` be shot like the show
so they were watching. 
> get shot in the head

i don't know if that's true, but the sad thing is that Helen was shot in `the` head is sent to the hospital immediately via ~~an~~ ambulence is put ~~online~~ `on life` support and then dies about 2 days later 
it's a horrific, horrfic tragedy. 
> is put on life support

### 08:19

You know how I say i don't understand how this happened in January . We only find out about it in september now everyone is talking about it in October.
Here is the part that gets me. Ok so Helen, this young women with the rest of her life ahead of her, the college, `oberlin` college sends an email and `notifies` all the students that she passed 

but the university doesn't say how `she's` died
so many of her friends , and fellow classmates believe that `she's` killed herself
so that's kind of the narrative that `are` operating under 
> be operating under

then what we don't know is that apparently snow is indicted on second degree felony manslaughter charges in April

so this happens in January, someone dies ~~with~~  `during` this playing around 
and it's nowhere on social media. `like` how is that possible
how is ~~that~~ `it` kept such a secret

it's amasing. ~~it's~~ `especially` because as you mentioned, anna, she has 1.6 million follwers 
and snow ~~is~~ `was` very active on social media, this is not ~~someone~~ `somebody` who only posted once ~~a~~ `every` week or ~~in~~ two weeks.

Snow is always on social media, and continuing to ~~post~~ `pose` in their costplay costume and essentially 
still ~~reinteracting~~ `reenacting` some of these seemingly dangerous ~~ex~~ `acts` on social media ~~across all~~ `all across` this time
>pose
>reenacting
>all across this time

yeah, there was a lot of criticism that escpecially once this news came out that snow had done some videos where ~~there~~ `what` appears to be like , fake blood stains behind her, and there was some violence. `and you're like` how in the world can you do that if you are the one who allegedly pull the trigger and led to someone's death 
and you've now been charged with this
that's something that is perplexing here.

here's what also is intresting. she is indicted, right? and in April she isn't indicted she is free on bond but there're conditions 
> free on bond
> conditions

she has curfews . snow has curfews, and snows has conditions about not only the time that snow has to be home, but also drug testing and `a` few other restrictions 
~~it~~ turns out that snow has reportedly violated those conditions by going to an ~~animate~~ `anime` convention in Houston in July 

so apparently that's probally when things start to become maybe more public , because there're more and more of court appearences and judgements to against to.

### 11:18

so the whole social media part of this. The story explodes in September, and again I don't know how someone who lives a  life so prominently can somehow ~~scape~~ `skype` under this. 
> skate under this

Could it be all the multiple names? maybe the reporters cover in this. I have no idea that this person is such a tick-tocker and is such a celebrity, is that a possibility ?

I mean you know possibly although I would say that if I'm just putting my mind. My mindset in the mindset of Snow's attorney and i've seen in both criminal and civil cases where social media post become evidence during trials. 

it's just so easy, and ~~even you're not going to live the mad worlds~~ `even you go and delete them afterwards`, somebody said those posts, right? so at some point I don't know when Snow `started` to get legal counsel but probably the first thing the legal counsel should've told them is stop posting all these things that make you seem like you're not taking this seriously right 

Even if Snow has never indicted. the fact that something that they did caused an accident that killed a person a friend a colleague, a peer, you probably shouldn't ~~been~~ `be` posting things as if everything is completely normal right. People usually will take a break from social media actually. 

so I'm not really sure why news coverage never reached that level of posting, I mean, again Snow's posting was very prolific and the type of thing that Snow was posting were incredibly sensational when you think about `it` along the backdrop of what's going on  
>along the backdrop of 

And Snow received a lot of criticism from the costplay community and fans, that are very upset about this because there has been a human life that has been lost in all of this. and that's not really part of what this is. so it's not surprising, maybe Snow realized that it would've been a lot of backlash. 

it's really unclear i want to talk to you more about what's going on, maybe in her, in her mind, I do wanna share quote from Rolling Stone magzine. Snow's attorney said that this client in quote was incredibly remorseful about what took place the attorney claims that the Snow's family members didn't even know about Helen's death, or Snow's involvement until last month, until the story broke. How is that possible that no one knew this. Some had bail Snow out. This is the strangest thing I've ever heard. 

right. That doesn't make any sense. Police report, interrigation, investigation,...something, right. And Snow's family never heard about it? it doesn't make any sense to me. 

In fact, because it doesn't make any sense I'll say this porbably I'm gonna `venture` to say may not be true. because it's so illogical. ok, now, the attorney also says this to Rolling Stone, the trama `led` Snow `to` basically just shut down internally and not discuss this with anyone except the people they lived with. They didn't know how to deal with it. 

what we know for sure is if they did not receive any psychological help or counciling for this incident, so the attorney doesn't believe that Snow has receiving any counciling. `which again` I'll say, are you crazy ? 

this is a `traumatic` experience. so do you believe that this is what's happened that Snow who is the...who is accused here, of manslaughter , doesn't remeber anything , has shut down , and what the heck is going on here.

### 15:18

Trama can lead  to people reacting in a lot of different ways, and I know ~~there are~~ maybe some people who are listening and watching right now are thinking "oh. snow is the one who's tramatized ? what about the person who died ~~and~~ `in` their family?" I get it. but at the same time there was a big witness to a violence that none of ~~us~~ `them` ~~may~~ expected that night and there is sometimes trama related to being the person who witnesses any kind of violence, any kind of death, even if you're responsible for that accident or not . 

What doesn't make sense and what I'm fearful of is that i've not seen any providers come forward and say i'm the one who is treating snow or snow has given me permission to talk about or even snow saying themselves that they are actually diagnosed with this dissociative identity disorder where there is a lot of identities ~~and~~ `in` play.

I'm worried that if it is not ~~embonified~~ `a bona fide` condition that snow had, this is gonna be part of defense, which is well, one of my alter-you-gos was the one I was there with that night who shot Helen. I the main personality of snow has no idea about how or when that happened. and I didn't know about it for weeks. 
> a bona fide

I do want to ask about this this DID dissociative identity disorder. there's a lot of talk, espeicially in the cost community, cosplay community, that some people get so involved in this characters to some degree, that the role playing goes beyond and they actually assume that entire personality . Can you elaborate on what any of these means 

absolutely and this whole piece of story that dissociative identity disorder piece is really really fascinating, because the dissociative identity disorder has been named something else in the past, that may be even more sensational. 

Years ago, in the DSM, which is our diagnostic manual for psychologist and psychiatrist. It was called multiple personality disorder. Now think a little bit more about that and how sensational that sounds. and so they changed the name to dissociative identity disorder. but there's a long history of people fanning having multiple personality disorder or disociative identity disorder in order to escape all kinds of reponsibilities. 

And that really takes the way from the true sufferer of this condition. which by the way is extremely rare. it's probably under 1% of people who truely suffer that in any 12-month period. and it's something that needs to be taken very sreiously for the person who truely suffer from it but to your point Anna, there's been more and more of cumminity where it's cosplay or you see this on tik-tok where there's a little boring who really has this disorder or who is basically putting on the show. this is basically just them acting out different experiences and people 

but they're saying they have DID because it is sensational once again right now. i was sensational in 80s and apparently it's coming back. and there's a huge tik-tock communitiy of people right now who say they have dissociative identity disorder

even if you just look at the percentages that take this, it doesn't make sense that all of them truely do. right. So what dissociative identity disorder is is the existence of true or more distinc identities of personalities . and these identies are acompanied by changes of behavior memory and thinking. and the sicne and symptoms are observable by others or reported by individual themselves. 

the individual experiences the gap in its memory about everyday events, personal information, past tramatic events and basically they don't have continueing their existence they black out and then a day later they'll come to and hear one of their alters and personalties took over and the symptom tend cause the individual a ton of distress and impact their daily functioning in very negative way. 

so that's one thing I would really like to see as a 
snow doesn't seem like they're that upset about all of this, they seem like they ravel this experience 

so if that's the case they don't have dissociative identity disorder people who truely have it they hate the fact that they have this they want to be treated they are not necessary put it on the show for everybody in the world to witness.

That's fascinating. and also I think that a ==broader== issue which is not specific to this but more to social media is how some people get so ==wrapped up== in this persona that they create for social media that gets ==attention== and the ==necessity to feed==, that ==attention== and get more ==followers== you're looking, who commented who did this who liked . that really can ==get out of hand==, you know

when you're living in your life in a virtual way 

and then ==compounded==, and one of the reasons that Helen was back in Houston is because of COVID, and she managed to get through semaster ==at== school and then they shut down this constant thing we've all been dealing with. and that kind of put her in this position besides of the fact that Helen was friends with Snow

I wanna take ==a little tangent== if I may with you because you were talking about the trama of either of experiencing this, being the person who pulled the trigger, or the person who was there. 

Everyone is talking about Actor Alec Baldwin, and the accident, the horrific fatal accident that occured during a rehearsal for a movie in New Mexico where Alec Baldwin was handed a ==prop gun==, and fired and then accidentally shot and killed a ==cinematographer== and shot the director in the shoulder and as of this morning, the prosecutor in the case is saying this is criminal investigation and there may be criminal charges, not suggesting that It's gonna be Alec Baldwin, but the case, the shooting is being investigated, the only reason I bring this up is, because we have a little bit of a similar scenario here. 

==except== of course in Houston, with Snow there were no ==boundries in the sense of== ==prop master== and all that ==what's your take on that== trama this is caused. 

I believe everybody who witnessed this including of course Allen Bowen himself, but everybody ==on set== that day, I think that they all probably need to at least be educated on the fact that probably all going to have some level of ==post-traumatic stress== reaction of varying ==severities== and that should be offered grief counseling 

again, this is a movie set, people tend to think even when they are playing prosub scene danger of 

this is acting, this is the movie set, in ....it's not the first time, we've seen that in hitorcial movies, 

movie productions as well

I think eveybody there is going to have some kind of reactions trying to block it out  ...recurring nightmare, but they don't wanted to 

drinking more, or doing drugs, block these memories, 

and a lot of people are having difficulties being concentrating doing things there were blaming themselves is there anthere something else I should've been doing

they run these scenarios over and over 

now when individuals do that , you wouldn't at the same time they also be posting on tik-tok, 

that is something that Snow is going to contend with and as this investigation go further

why Snow is going this way

and it seemed very gleanful, and fun, and light heart it about 

and I think that's the difference 

people have seen him cry outside I mean he looks the sponding 

people expect trama like this 

exatcly exatcly it's so hard to have this conversation and include that in the broughter just because of what's going on, you know, one is ameture video, one is professional 

just a few, a few simularities, so , Snow is charged with manslauting manner, Snow is expected to court this week to find enter a plea, no...charge in this case, 

now just a littile bit more about Halen, the victim, so absolution, Halen's parents are absolutely distraught, and they are prominent scientists in Texas, and don't believe their daughter would ever asked to be shot in the head for any kind of role playing, costume, whatever, or whatever is going on.

so they're especially upset, that Snow carry on to nothing happened, 

and you know, that's part of the continued disrepectful life, 

that's how I vew 

where is the sense of the pology,

we're not seeing this at all

Here's interesting though, Halen's sister tells the reporter that she doesn't not want Snow to go to prison for this. 

yeah, it's very interesting, isn't it? 

I don't know what's that about, and again, this is from ....so it could be incorrect, or...

but that's what we are in this case, and we'll see what the plea is and it's very interesting, very complicated , multiple, you know, so much is going on, virtual, real, it's just, it's get so blurred, 

right, it does, and I think that, again, if somebody truly has dissociative identity disorder there's certain invigaing factors, that the courses are more considered, this is the person who treament 

is that part of their sentencing she considered that and if that person  being rehabitated, 

but I also again, the fact that among the history, people get malinger to have certain mental health in order to escape prison sentences in order to escape harsher sentences it's not successful but they tried 

and I really hope for the sake jut the mental health community, people who truly suffer from this dissociative identity disorder that if that's trully what happened that I 

but if they not, contributing more to this already hight simitizing condition, because people who truly have did they are more likely to be the victm of perpatrate it

the fact that Snow
