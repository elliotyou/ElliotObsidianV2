we're always so thrilled to have you here
you are one of our favortes of course (we say that to everybody)
we don't wanna hurt `anybody's` feeling but you really are one of our favortes 
these 2 cases are actually, Judy, are the kind of cases where we need your level of `expertise` 
we always try when `you're coming on` to make sure that we maximize your `expertise` 
>be coming on

so `we're putting you to` work today
a nurse in texas is convicted of killing patients by injecting air into their arteries right after heart surgery 
the `nurse's` atterny says the hospital is the one that had issues, and the hospital is making the nurse a `scapegoat`
>arteries
>scapegoat

so of course the question is, which is very jarring to the rest of us, how could a `caregiver` ever turn around and `then` be accused `as` the one trying to injure and kill people. it's very jarring 
>jarring

and the nurse is now facing the death penalty 
but first, a social media `star` `is` accused of shooting and killing a friend during a drunken night in `Houston` but her arrest was somehow `kept from the` public for `months`

I don't how you can live your life so publicly and yet have this case be buried 
this to me is the most fascenating and suspicious part of this. 
although there're many suspicious things here. 
ok, so, dr. Judy, let's set up what the crime is, and how it's described by Texas' authorities
>live sb's life
>and yet
>have sth buried
>this to me

and then you can jump in with your expertiese 
so, they said that on January 17th `of` this year, 
there was a shooting in the Houston home of a `tick-tock` star known for costplay videos 
>tick-tock

costplay, being short for costume play , and I guess Judy, people dress up as characters often from the `world` animation, comics, `sci-fi` many reenact scenes, or they create environments in which they play that character
it's a huge `interactive` community 
do you think that's a good description of costplay 
>the world animation

yeah, you know i `was` actually a huge fan of costplay, especially during `grad` school, cuz i'm a video gamer, and i love cartoon and anime and those were some of the costumes that we dressed up in when I was younger with my friends 
>cartoon and anime
>grad school

and i've actually been `to` conferences and ~~the fans~~ `events`  ~~were~~ `where` basically `there's` a huge amount of costplay 

i guess fans ~~of~~ `or` the costplay community being ~~presented~~ `present at` those for example comic cons, `it was` in San Diego many many years.
>sth being present at ....

`and that's where` `i went to` my doctor program. `and a lot of my firends and i would go to these conferences `
>that's where ....

so i know exactly what you are talking about 

oh my god the secret life of dr. judy hill. I love it !

i know it's so weird, `like people are like` wait a minute, i've been playing video games since i was 5 years old

so i grew up ~~with~~ `on` stuff like street fighter, ~~takin~~ `Tekken`,  `Mortal Kombat`, you know `and` things like that. and they ~~are~~ were always ~~being~~ `big` ~~apperence~~ `appearences` `at these` costply conferences 
>Tekken: 鐵拳系列
>Mortal Kombat: 真人快打
>be big appearences at ...
>grew up on stuff li ke ...

oh my god you really are the perfect person for this case beyond anything I've ever expected 
it's like a bonus today, a bonus episode

ok now let's talk about the crime and people involved here. 

### 03:56

this `tick-tocker` went by serveral names and several handles 
`Marianne`, Oliver Snow, is 23 years old, and goes by, and uses the ~~day~~  `they them` pronounced 
Snow went by `Yandere Freak` that's one of the names and also by the name of snow the salt queen 
> handles
> go by

so we're gonna just refer to this `individual` as snow 
i think it just makes it easier for all of us to follow 
snow as 1.6 million follwers on tick tock, which is a lot
 
snow is considered as a celebrity expecially in the Houston area, where snow recorded videos and has a reputation for using real weapons
and knives and swords in some of the videos
so apperently snow and 5 firends were snow's house 

they admitted there were drinking, smoking pot, watching TV, and they all started playing out some scenes, 
snow allegedly picked up gun, snow said that, it had been left behind by snow's boy firend, 
> smoke pot

and so , there're something going on, they are playing, they are doing these things, and then snow points the gun at the head of one of snow's friends, pulls the trigger, killing 19-year-old `Helen Hastings`, who was a student at `Oberlin` `college`

so...part of a mistery here is..well...first of all, this is a loaded gun, and we see this play out ~~of~~ an awful lot, where people play with loaded guns and this is the absolute worst thing ~~it~~ `that` can happen
>an awful lot
