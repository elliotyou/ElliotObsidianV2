Little Johnny's in class, and then teacher asked him a question.
There're 5 birds on a power line, and someone shoots one, how many birds are left. and little Jonny goes...None, because they all be scared away from the gunshot. Teacher's like "no, there'll be four, but I like the way you think"

little Johnny goes "ok, I have a question for you then". There're 3 women eating ice cream, one sucking, one licking and one is biting. Who's married? Who...Who's married, mom?

No, the one with a wedding ring, but I like the way you think.
